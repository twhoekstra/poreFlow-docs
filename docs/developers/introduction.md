## Overview of contribution process

Changes to poreFlow are typically done by members of the Cees Dekker lab. Members first clone the repository to their 
personal computer, then make a branch in which they edit the source code, and then push the local cahnges back up to 
GitLab. When changes are done, the member creates a pull request to incorporate their changes into the codebase.

This page will contain both the style guide for the module, along with instructions to set up your local development 
environment. Note that the style guide below is more of a recommendation than a decree: if write clean code in a 
different style, please go ahead. If you are still looking to learn however, these guidelines might be a good place 
to start.
