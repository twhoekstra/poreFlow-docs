## Coding conventions

1. **Tested.** All new functionality would ideally include test coverage. For learning more about tests, consult the 
[pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/index.html). Make tests fast.
2. **Documented.** All new functionality must be documented, preferably through these docs along with docstrings
in the source code.
3. **Minimize API changes**. Please minimize changes to the public API. Changes to the public API 
(e.g., class/function/method names and signatures) should not be made lightly, as they can break existing user scripts.

## Code style
1. **Follow the Google Python Style Guide** Consult the 
[Google Style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/). To format the code, see the [formatting instructions](#formatting-code).
2. **Google-style docstrings** Write 
[Google-style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings) docstrings.
